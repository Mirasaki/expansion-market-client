# expansion-market-client

A Discord client that interacts with the Expansion Market backend/API. This application is part of a bundle of proprietary software and is not useful on it's own. The purpose of open-sourcing is merely to have a place for the community to share feedback/critique without having to host a ghost-repository. This client uses my [discord.js-bot-template](https://github.com/Mirasaki/discord.js-bot-template) and therefor shares the same MIT license - meaning you can use this software/code any way you want, as long as a copy of the LICENSE is included. View [LICENSE](/LICENSE) for more details on the full licensing.
